# spotify-challenge

This webpage service allows users to search the Spotify API to explore music content.
Users can save their favorite tracks so they'll remember to add them to their Spotify Playlist.

The website is hosted on my student server space: http://students.washington.edu/mtpham13/info343/spotify-challenge
